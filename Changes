02 Oct 03 released Alpha3

- After MAX_UNREASONABLES "unreasonable" coordinates they become reasonable
  (helps recovery from errors that would otherwise loose the mouse)

- Add 1 second tick to cause X events to be polled, sets max bound
  when doing a paste to the X side [bug from pkumar]

- Check number of buttons on -to side and don't send mousewheel events
  if buttons 4/5 are not ok. [bug from chaiken]

- Check for not becomming foreground, and try to recover, become aggresive
  if events are turning up on the wrong window  [Bug from Thomas] 

- Fix cursor warp (west) so it goes one left of return coordinate
  [Bug from Thomas]

- Extra message printing if -DDEBUGCHATTY [mdh]

- Version of -capslockhack code in Windows KeyEvent processing
  [Bug from Thomas and mdh]

- Add magic key sequences for -fromwin:
       RightAlt-Home to force cursor back to Windows
       RightAlt-End to exit x2x

- Known issue: Both left and right shift keys on Windows cause left shift on X.

- make -fromwin imply -capslockhack, and add -nocapslockhack option

- Fix to allow -east work before -fromwin on command line [Bug from Thomas]

- Add comment in usage with Thomas' tip on making a shortcut to launch x2x

Changed files:
Imakefile
keymap.c
x2x.c
x2xwin.rc (bump version)

Added files:
winmsg.c - This is a quick hack to turn Windows message numbers into
           a string so I can print them. Only when -DDEBUGCHATTY


27 Oct 2003 Beta 1
------------------

- Added code from Thomas Chadwick to save Windows focus when going to X
  and restore on the way back (good for click-to-focus)

- Added code from Thomas Chadwick to send a fake mouse click to Windows
  when x2x is havig problems getting the focus (good for click-to-focus)

- Support the -buttonblock flag in the -fromwin code

- Add description of -fromwin to the manpage

- Make man file x2x.man so that the makefile will build x2x.1.html
  and the install will install x2x.1

- Add to BUGS section of the man page that Ctrl-Alt-Del on the Windows
side will leave the Ctrl and Alt keys stuck down on the X server and that
pressing and releasing Ctrl and Alt should fix this.

- Default to no -DDEBUG

- Bump version to Beta

- Add -clipcheck option and relax clipboard copy checking to windows
if it is not given (allows other than plain XA_STRING copies, eg emacs
keeps giving me a COMPOUND_TEXT type)
