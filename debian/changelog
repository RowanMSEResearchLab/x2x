x2x (1.27-5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * use debhelper rather than cpbs - it's more standard and gives us FHS
  * compile with "-g -O2" as per policy
  * merge in patch from Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net> to map buttons and not
    send any which the remote end can't handle (closes: #80629, #56252)
  * patches downloaded from http://www.eax.com/other/x2x-1.27-1.28.patch:
    - unofficial x2x-1.28 patch from Adam Sulmcki <adam@cfar.umd.edu>
      which adds an error handler (closes: #56252).  NB: I have only applied
      the cleanup parts of the patch since #80629 fixes the problem better.
      I've left the patch in debian/errorhandler.diff in case it's needed in
      future.
    - from Greg J. Badros <gjb@cs.washington.edu>:
      -  fix for the feedback loop which can arise
      -  save some screen estate
  * patch from Ben Harris <bjh21@cam.ac.uk> to change title of window
    (closes: #54045)
